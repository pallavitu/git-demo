hello
this is the first line for a demo file
to use for git project, commit etc

#ipsum below
just type whatever you want. this is to modify the file and check to see how GIT tracks the changes.
then may be commit the modified changes from local working area to GIT staging area. and then commit the changes to git repo.
this is all being done locally.
