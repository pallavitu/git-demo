hello
this is the first line for a demo file
to use for git project, commit etc

#ipsum below
just type whatever you want. this is to modify the file and check to see how GIT tracks the changes.
then may be commit the modified changes from local working area to GIT staging area. and then commit the changes to git repo.
this is all being done locally.
#more chnages
earlier we modified the file. in the local working directory. then the file was added to git staging area or index by usin
git add command. after that, to commit the changes to the repo, we used commit command. then the working directory was clearn
and the changes were committed to git repo.
now lets see if there is an easier way of doing this, instead of doing git add, git commit
